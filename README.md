ComposeUI is a A .NET Core based general UI Container and Unified UI and App host which enables the hosting of Web and desktop content.

Our goal is to fill the feature gaps with respect to UI components, layout management, and subpar native hosting in other industry container solutions by providing a standard container as an open desktop platform. It is a hybrid solution that meets the needs of a diverse application catalog as well as a compelling opensource alternative.

It supports desktop and web applications in order to provide an evergreen alternative to Electron, OpenFin and similar by the use of WebView2.

# Development Setup
## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18
- .NET 6 (SDK 6.0.x, Desktop Runtime 6.0.x)
- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

## Building the ComposeUI Container


Clone the main repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/morganstanley/ComposeUI.git
```

### From Visual Studio IDE

Build the "Shell.sln" solution.

By doing this the build is kicked off to all the other solutions it depends on.

### From Terminal

To build the Nuget and NPM packages without an IDE open Powershell in the ComposeUI folder.

1. Build javascript (with Lerna)

```
C:\projects\ComposeUI> .\build\lerna-build.ps1
```

If you only want to build a specific package see [how to build packages with Lerna](#building-the-javascript-dependencies-with-lerna)


2. Restore nuget packages:

```
C:\projects\ComposeUI> .\build\dotnet-restore.ps1
```

3. Build .NET solutions:

```
C:\projects\ComposeUI> .\build\dotnet-build.ps1
```

Now the necessary artifacts have been built.

## Building the Examples

### FDC3 Chart and Grid Example

From the ComposeUI folder:

```
.\examples\fdc3-chart-and-grid\serve-chart-and-grid.ps1
```
Now the development servers are running:

- Chart: localhost:8080
- Grid: localhost:4200

### Launching the Shell with the Examples

#### From Visual Studio

Start the "Shell" project.

You can add a new launch setting in the IDE or by adding a new entry to the `$(ProjectRoot))\src\shell\dotnet\Shell\Properties\launchSettings.json` file

### From Terminal

1. It's recommended to add the shell binary to your PATH environment variable so you can use a shorthand:

```
cd .src\shell\dotnet\
```
```
.\add-to-path.ps1
```
2. Launch the FDC3 Example in the ComposeUI Shell:

```
MorganStanley.ComposeUI.Shell --ModuleCatalog:CatalogUrl file:///C:/ComposeUI/src/Shell/dotnet/examples/module-catalog.json --FDC3:AppDirectory:Source C:/ComposeUI/examples/fdc3-appdirectory/apps-with-intents.json
```

### Serving web application

[See](#fdc3-chart-and-grid-example)
 

### Running the Shell

1. Open the Shell Solution
2. Choose "Shell" as the startup project
3. Run




## Building the JavaScript Dependencies with Lerna

The javascript dependencies are managed by a lerna monorepo. To build them separately follow the steps below.

### Run scripts

In the root folder

```
npm i
```

Build all modules:

```
npx lerna run build --stream
```
Test all modules:

```
npx lerna run test --stream
```
(If you don't want a detailed log, you can execute these without --stream)

Building a specific module:

```
npx lerna run build --stream --scope=@morgan-stanley/composeui-messaging-client
```

List all modules in the workspace

```
npx lerna list
```

### Docs

For more information check the [documentation](https://lerna.js.org/docs/api-reference/commands).

## How to Run the FDC3 Conformance test Locally

1. Clone the [FDC3 Conformance Framework](https://github.com/finos/FDC3-conformance-framework) and build it: 
2.add the following to the `$((ProjectRoot))\src\shell\dotnet\Shell\Properties\launchSettings.json` file:

```
    "FDC3-Local": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "commandLineArgs": "--ModuleCatalog:CatalogUrl \"file:///$(ProjectDir)..\\examples\\module-catalog.json\" --FDC3:AppDirectory:Source $((FDC3ConformanceRoot))\\FDC3-conformance-framework\\directories\\local-conformance-2_0.v2.json"
    }
```

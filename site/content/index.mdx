    <Article title="Background">
    ComposeUI is a .NET based, WebView2 using UI Container for hybrid web-desktop applications.
    Our goal is to fill the feature gaps with respect to UI components, layout management,
    and subpar native hosting in other industry container solutions by providing a standard
    container as an open desktop platform. It is a hybrid solution that meets the needs of
    a diverse application catalog as well as a compelling opensource alternative.

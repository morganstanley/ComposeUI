## Context

We wish to provide flexibility in the usage of ComposeUI interfaces and components.

## Decision

In order to allow more flexibility in Shell imlementations, we will switch abstractions and plugins implemented by ourselves to .net standard 2.0.
This enables using .NET Framework for implementing a shell or integrating components of ComposeUI in existing technology.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered multi-targeting our packages but it would considerably increase development and maintenance effort with lower benefits.

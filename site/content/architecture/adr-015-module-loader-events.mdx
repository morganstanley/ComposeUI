## Context

Module Loader is responsible for starting and stopping module instances. It is also responsible for emitting lifetime events of module instances, such as `Starting`, `Started`, `Stopping`, `Stopped`.

The current architecture is built on top of `IObservable<T>`:

```c#
public interface IModuleLoader
{
    IObservable<LifetimeEvent> LifetimeEvents { get; }

    // other members omitted for brevity
}
```

### Current usages

#### Raising events

The Module Loader is responsible for raising lifetime events. This is currently achieved by using a [Subject](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/reactive-extensions/hh229173(v=vs.103)>). Subjects implement both `IObservable<T>` and `IObserver<T>`, and when a lifetime event needs to be emitted we call `OnNext()` on the subject.

#### Consuming events

Module Loader lifetime events are consumed by ComposeUI infrastructure code, but can also be consumed by external applications.

Current infrastructure usages utilize `System.Reactive` extensions and its `LINQ` operators. For example:

```c#
internal sealed class ModuleService : IHostedService
{
    // ...
    public Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _disposables.Add(
            _moduleLoader.LifetimeEvents
                .OfType<LifetimeEvent.Started>()
                .Where(e => e.Instance.Manifest.ModuleType == ModuleType.Web)
                .Subscribe(OnWebModuleStarted));
```

This usage filters lifetime events by type and by content to subscribe only to the `Started` events of `Web` module instances.

Another usage uses the `ObserveOn()` extension method which ensures that the observer's `OnNext()` method is invoked via the specified scheduler, in this case using the `DispatcherSynchronizationContext` from WPF.

In our FDC3 Desktop Agent implementation we use `System.Reactive.Async` to convert the `IObservable<T>` events to `IAsyncObservable<T>` so that the `OnNext()` calls are properly awaited:

```c#
        var observable = _moduleLoader.LifetimeEvents.ToAsyncObservable();
        var subscription = await observable.SubscribeAsync(async lifetimeEvent =>
        {
            // code containing await
```

## Alternatives considered

### Events

The most obvious alternative to `IObservable<T>` is the built-in `event` feature in C# / .NET. Raising lifetime events would be very similar to the current code, however subscribing to these events would be limited to the `+=` operator. Since we're already relying on the `LINQ` operators provided by Rx.NET using built-in `events` instead would be inferior.

The current implementation of the FDC3 Desktop Agent relies on awaiting in the `OnNextAsync()` handler. Implementing the same behavior by using built-in `events` would be challenging (if possible at all).

### `IAsyncObservable<T>`

`IAsyncObservable<T>` is part of `System.Reactive.Async` package, for which the latest available version as of today is 6.0.0-alpha.18, which is a pre-release version.

We are already using this package internally but we don't want to enforce pre-release dependencies on our customers by changing the public interface to use `IAsyncObservable<T>`.

## Decision

We continue using `IObservable<T>` for Module Loader lifetime events.

## Consequences

We will revisit this ADR once there will be a stable version of `System.Reactive.Async` package available.

# MorganStanley.ComposeUI.Messaging.Core

`MorganStanley.ComposeUI.Messaging.Core` provides the core infrastructure and utilities for the ComposeUI Message Router. It supplies essential building blocks, serialization, and concurrency support for messaging components and services. This package is primarily intended for internal use by other ComposeUI messaging packages and advanced users who need low-level messaging primitives.

## Features

- Core message serialization and deserialization utilities
- Concurrency and synchronization primitives for messaging scenarios
- Shared infrastructure for building messaging clients, hosts, and adapters
- Designed for extensibility and high performance
- Compatible with .NET 8.0

## Installation

Install via NuGet:

```shell
dotnet add package MorganStanley.ComposeUI.Messaging.Core
```

Or via the NuGet Package Manager:
